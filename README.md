# Markdown Syntax Highlighting for Notepad++

**Notepad++** doesn't have syntax highlighting for **Markdown** out of the box.

This user-defined syntax file is meant to be used along with the Monokai theme (it is the theme I use).

### Setting up Monokai Theme

On Notepad++ menu bar:

- Select _Settings_ -> _Style Configurator..._
- Click on the _Select theme :_ drop-down
- Scroll to and select `Monokai`

### Installing Markdown Syntax Highlighter

Navigate to the Notepad++ installation folder.

If you don't see a file named `userDefineLang.xml` simply copy the one found in this repo and paste it within the Notepad++ installation folder.

Otherwise, if the file already exists, simply append the contents from the `userDefineLang.xml` file in this repo to the one found within the Notepad++ installation folder.
